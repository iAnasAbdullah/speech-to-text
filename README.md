# speech-to-text
this is a speech-to-text website that uses voice to convert it to text which uses arabic langauge on the speaking part.

:: HOW IT WORKS ::

The website contains a button in the middle which will trigger a speaking function from the web API, it will require you to allow for mic usage.
after enabling the mic, the text below will change into "LISTENING..." which then you will start speaking.
if the website got what you said, the text on the middle will change into whatever you said in arabic (it must be known on the arabic grammer or atleast make sense in arabic)
